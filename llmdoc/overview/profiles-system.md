# Profiles System

## 1. Identity

- **What it is:** Environment profile management for quick configuration switching.
- **Purpose:** Save, load, and share environment configurations as named profiles.

## 2. High-Level Description

The Profiles System allows users to create named snapshots of their environment configurations (selected runtimes, global versions, local project settings). Profiles can be quickly applied to switch between different development setups, exported for backup, or shared with team members. The system supports profile creation from current state, import/export as JSON, and bulk operations on multiple environments.
